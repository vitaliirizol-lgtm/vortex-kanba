  # Fix Infinite Recursion in RLS Policies

  1. Problem
    - RLS policies are causing infinite recursion when checking project_members
    - The policies reference project_members table within project access checks
    - This creates circular dependencies

  2. Solution
    - Create helper functions to check project access
    - Use these functions in policies to avoid direct table references
    - Simplify the policy structure

  3. Security
    - Maintain proper access control
    - Ensure team members can access shared projects
    - Prevent unauthorized access
